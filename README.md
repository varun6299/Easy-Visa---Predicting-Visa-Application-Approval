## üìå Problem Statement & Context
The **Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC)** in the US reviews hundreds of thousands of visa applications annually. In FY 2016, over **775,000 applications** were filed for nearly **1.7 million positions** ‚Äî a **9% increase** year-on-year.

Manual reviews are **time-intensive**, creating bottlenecks in processing. To improve efficiency, OFLC partnered with **EasyVisa** to leverage **machine learning** to:
- Predict whether a visa application will be **Certified** or **Denied**.
- Identify key **predictors of approvals**.
- Support policymakers and employers with **data-driven decisions**.

---

## üéØ Objective
Develop a **classification model** to predict visa case outcomes (`Certified` vs. `Denied`) and uncover insights into applicant and employer factors influencing decisions.

### Dataset Features
- **case_id**: Unique application ID  
- **continent**: Applicant‚Äôs continent of origin  
- **education_of_employee**: Education level (High School, Bachelor‚Äôs, Master‚Äôs, Doctorate)  
- **has_job_experience**: Prior work experience (Y/N)  
- **requires_job_training**: Whether job requires training (Y/N)  
- **no_of_employees**: Employer size  
- **yr_of_estab**: Year company established  
- **region_of_employment**: US region of employment  
- **prevailing_wage**: Benchmark wage for role  
- **unit_of_wage**: Hourly, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly  
- **full_time_position**: Full-time (Y/N)  
- **case_status**: Target variable (Certified/Denied)

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Findings
- **Education:** Approval probability rises with education ‚Äî from **63% (Bachelor‚Äôs)** to **86% (Doctorate)**.  
- **Experience:** Experienced applicants had ~**75% approval**, compared to ~**50%** for non-experienced.  
- **Geography:**  
  - **Asia:** ~66% approval  
  - **Europe:** ~81% approval  
  - **US Midwest region:** ~75% approval (highest among regions).  
- **Training:** Requirement for training showed **minimal influence** on approval.  
- **Full-time vs. Part-time:** Both saw approval rates above **66%**.  
- **Company Metrics (size, year established, wages):** Had limited predictive power.

## ü§ñ Modeling Approach
- **Models Tested:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, XGBoost  
- **Imbalance Handling:** SMOTE, Random Under-Sampling, Tomek Links  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV for boosting models

## üí° Business Insights & Recommendations
1. **Prioritize Highly Educated Applicants**  
   - Doctorate and Master‚Äôs holders show the **highest approval rates**.  
   - Suggest fast-tracking highly educated workers to fill **specialized roles**.  

2. **Leverage Experience as a Key Driver**  
   - Work experience boosts approval by ~25 percentage points.  
   - Employers should emphasize relevant prior work when applying.  

3. **Regional Considerations**  
   - Midwest and South US regions have higher approval rates.  
   - Policymakers can encourage applications targeting these geographies.  

4. **Wage & Training Neutrality**  
   - Prevailing wages and training requirements had **little impact** on outcomes.  
   - Suggest policy efforts focus more on **skills & education** than wage adjustments.  

5. **Balanced Campaign Targeting**  
   - By using ML model scores, EasyVisa can rank applicants by **approval likelihood**.  
   - High-score applicants: **priority for manual review**.  
   - Low-score applicants: **automated processing** to save time.
